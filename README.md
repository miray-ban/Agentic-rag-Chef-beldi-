Chef Beldi: An AI-Powered Culinary Assistant with Agentic RAG  🍽️🤖

Ever found yourself staring at your kitchen, wondering: “What can I cook today?” 🤔

You might search online, get overwhelmed by choices, and still not find a recipe that fits your ingredients, preferences, or dietary needs.
Enter Chef Beldi—an intelligent AI assistant that revolutionizes the way we interact with culinary knowledge. Not just a chatbot, but an Agentic RAG system that retrieves, evaluates, and personalizes recipes dynamically.

🎯 The Vision
In a world overflowing with information, Chef Beldi acts as your AI-powered kitchen assistant, ensuring you get:
✅ Smart recipe suggestions based on what you have.
✅ Personalized dietary recommendations (whether you’re vegan, gluten-free, or just looking for healthy options).
✅ A learning experience—it explains the “why” behind the recipes, helping you become a better cook.
✅ Reliable responses with real-time verification.
✅ Seamless user experience across different platforms—including web, mobile, and even WhatsApp.

🚀 Why Chef Beldi Stands Out?

✨ Smart Retrieval + AI Generation: Combines knowledge retrieval with AI’s creativity for the best culinary suggestions.
✨ Personalized Cooking Experience: Adapts recipes to your diet, allergies, and available ingredients.
✨ AI-Powered Reliability: No more misleading or irrelevant recipe suggestions.
✨ Flexible & Scalable: Whether through web apps, mobile, or WhatsApp, the experience remains seamless.
